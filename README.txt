This project adds a data field to your Garmin bike computer, built using Garmin Connect IQ (CIQ).

It allows your bike computer to connect to a Forumslader V5 using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 
and display useful information (like battery percentage, battery current, speed) while cycling.

You're welcome to raise issues and open pull requests to support development of this app.
